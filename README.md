  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  share_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  accessor_ip VARCHAR(45),
  user_agent CLOB,
  accessed_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  access_type ENUM('VIEW', 'DOWNLOAD') NOT NULL
)

share_notifications (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
  share_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
  recipient_email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  sent_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
  delivered BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  notification_id VARCHAR(36) UNIQUE
)
```

**Indexes Created**:
- `idx_file_owner` on (file_id, owner_id)
